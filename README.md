# Person-Re-Identification
My work and implementations on person re-identification using PyTorch.

## Implementation 1 - Simple Siamese Network:
Simple Siamese Network for proximity based embedding of similar images. It utilizes the triplet loss function for training.

Reasons to Use Siamese Neural Network : 
* Needs less training Examples to classify images because of One-Shot Learning
* Learn by Embedding of the image so that it can learn Semantic Similarity
* It helps in ensemble to give the best classifiers because of its correlation properties.
* Mainly used for originality verification.
